        <p>Msurshima is a young developer who studied computer science at a Nigerian University. <br>
            Knowing what the Nigerian practical space is like, it did introduce her properly to the world<br>of technology
            but failed to cover a lot that would help her hands get busy. Now Msurshima<br>is on a mission 
            to become a PRO software developer, data analyst and Human and Computer Interaction<br>(HCI) expert  
            after 4 years of studying computer science. Wish this youngin some luck, she'll need it.
